Add eyes to MiniCat
Using OLEDs screens 128x64

Need U8G2 library by olikraus 
>>> https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2 

WARNING 
Code to be uploaded on a second board as U8G2 lib is too heavy to fit 
in the same board as MiniCat

Need to connect 1st board Vin, GND and IR data pins to 2nd board. 
OLEDs screens are both connected to VCC, GND, SDA (A4) and SCL (A5) of 2nd board.
